                 <h1 id="firstSubject">Laptops</h1>
                 <p>Finding your next computer doesn’t have to be a chore.
                
                  If you’re looking for something you can easily carry to and from work, or bring with you on vacation, then a lightweight laptop could be in order. These weigh just a couple of pounds, have batteries that can last a full workday of more than 8 hours, and have more than enough power to tackle common productivity tasks like browsing the web and editing Microsoft Office documents. Some models, known as 2-in-1s, can be used as a tablet of sorts by bending the keyboard backward and behind the screen using a 360-degree hinge.                    
                  And though the great Mac vs. PC debate isn’t likely to end, a Mac can do about as much as a PC though you’ll want a PC if you’re into gaming). Both have access to top-tier software, include robust anti-malware protection, and are easy to use: For instance, Google Chrome and Microsoft Word are basically the same on Macs and PCs.</p>
                
                  <h3>Intel Processors</h3>
                  <p>Intel's main processors are the Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9. The Core i3 is the least powerful, the Core i9 is the most powerful. We usually drop the "Core" from the name because it gets repetitive.
                    
                      Within each of these chip lines, Intel uses cryptic strings of numbers and letter</p>  
                    
                  <h3>SSD Storage or Spinning Drive</h3>
                  <p>The hard drive is where you'll store all your data. Think of this as the filing cabinet next to your desk. The most common choice these days is a solid state drive (SSD), although some budget laptops still use spinning drives. Go for an SSD drive if you can afford it—at least 256 gigabytes. SSDs are faster, especially if they use an NVMe connection, which moves data in and out of the hard drive much quicker than the older standard, known as SATA. Sometimes </p>
                    
                  <h3>Webcams and Hinges</h3>
                  <p>Your laptop should have a webcam. For some reason, there are still laptops in 2021 that don't have them. Most webcams are still 720p, especially on lower-priced laptops. That's fine if you're not using it much, but with Zoom being a way of life for many folks these days, you might be happier with a 1080p camera.</p> 
                    
                  <h3>Graphics Card</h3>
                  <p>All laptops technically have graphics cards (also called “discrete” graphics and GPU), but most are bundled into the motherboard with the processor. This approach, known as "integrated graphics" is fine for most users. You'll be able to watch HD movies and even play casual games without issue.</p>  
                    
                  <h3>RAM</h3>
                  <p>The more the merrier! Random-access memory, known as RAM, is what your laps things with it. ThinkYou usually get a primary lens which sports the highest MP count, a portrait lens, and a wide-angle shooter. And then, you also have a few extras that some manufacturers add such as the ToF (Time of Flight) sensor, macro lens, and colour filter lens. We, at the Digit Labs, are fans of the wide-angle lens because of the magnitude of images you can now take on phones. Capturing sprawling scenes is not a problem anymore! The portrait lens, when done well, can produce spectacular bokeh shots too. However, if this trend just isn’t for you and the growing camera bumps enrage you, it would be best to buy older phones with one primary lens or newer ones such as the iPhone SE 2020. Also, don’t go MP hunting, higher megapixel-count doesn’t always mean better images since the sensor size is much more integral to producing good photos.</p>

                  <h3>A good display</h3> 
                  <p>Smartphone display sizes seem to be ever-increasing and are continually pushing the boundary of what we’d expect a smartphone display size to be. They’ve reached the ‘phablet’ realm with displays even reaching up to 6.9-inches!</p>

                  <h3>The right amount of storage</h3> 
                  <p>The current standard is 64GB on lower-end models and 128GB to 512GB on flagships. With swift sharing apps and technologies, almost all of us import every single GB of data from our previous phones to the new ones. So, adequate storage is essential. We recommend that you do not go under 128GB since it will give you </p> 

                  <h3>Battery life that fits your daily requirements</h3>
                  <p>The golden standard of battery life in flagship smartphones is 6+ hours of screen on time. Anything with higher capacities can mostly allow even heavy-users to power through. Flagship phones, as well as some mid-range phones, can also reach 8-10 hours of screen on time, which is brilliant. The goal is to get a phone that can at leas</p>  


                  <h3>Camera quality that justifies the price</h3>
                  <p>In 2020, multi-cameras are the norm and phones with just one rear camera are extremely rare now.

                    Smartphones have also been employing pixel-binning, which essentially turns four or more pixel into one big pixel, that adds clarity and detail to the image. Also, for now, try to stray away from the 108MP sensors since they’re pretty rough around the edges at the moment plagued with image fringing and autofocus issues. </p>

                 <h1 id="thirdSubject">HomeRouters</h1>
                 <p>One of the first considerations when choosing the best Wi-Fi router is to look for is the wireless standard being used. Very early routers used IEEE802.11a or 802.11b, but things have moved on significantly since then.

                     Often they are compatible with a number of the latest versions, but if the router is to be used for a number of years, it is best to ensure that it supports the latest standard. </p>


                 <h3>Wi-Fi standards</h3>
                 <p> In this way, the router will be able to provide the best performance. As they are backward compatible, even if there are some older devices that require connections, these can still be supported.


                     The latest standard is 802.11ac, which you see on all the newest routers. That means that the router can st least having he latest provides the best future-proofin</p>  

                 <h3>Wi-Fi speed specifications</h3>
                 <p>As might be expected all manufacturers will quote the top speed provided by the latest 802.11 standard supported by the router. In reality these speeds are rarely seen - they really only occur under ideal conditions set up in a laboratory. Multiple users, interference, signal attenuation caused by walls and other objects and a host of real-life issues will cause the speed to be reduced.</p>

                 <h3>Check the router wired interfaces</h3>
                 <p>There are several forms of Wi-Fi routers. Some are designed to be connected to broadband, whereas others are only designed for Ethernet, or possibly other connections. Often domestic orientated routers will have a connection for a broadband service as well as Ethernet, and possibly USB.</p> 

                 <h3>Broadband provider compatibility</h3>
                 <p>Wi-Fi routers are generally required to be linked to broadband provider. Check that any router you consider is compatible with the particular broadband service provider.

                     It is also worth remembering that broadband service providers, ISPs, tend to quote the maximum speeds available. When a </p>

                 <h3>Security</h3>
                 <p>Hackers are hitting the news headlines with regularity these days. Accordingly security is an important issue to consider when selecting the best router to buy.

                     Wireless networks can be very insecure - it has been said they are as insecure as they are convenient! Without securing the network properly anyone within range of the signal from the router can eavesdrop on what is going on and pick up secure information like bank and card details</p> 

                 <h3>Router antennas</h3>
                 <p>The antenna on any wireless item is very important, and the same is true for Wi-Fi routers and they should be taken into consideration when buying a Wi-Fi router.

                     When comparing routers, it an be seen that some models have antennas protruding from the case, typically on the top. Other routers have internal antennas and they tend to look more elegant, but the signal radiated is not as strong.</p>

                 <h3>Use as access point and repeater</h3>
                 <p>Many of today's routers can also be set up to perform as an access point or a repeater. This can be very useful when trying to cover a large area as it is often impossible to get good coverage from a singe router.

                     When buying a router that needs to perform in either of these functions check the specification because many routers but not all of them can perform in these roles.</p>
